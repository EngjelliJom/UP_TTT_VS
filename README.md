# UP_TTT_VS
Tic-Tac-Toe (C++) Console Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. Two players take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid, attempting to get three of their marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before the other.

Features
Two-player mode (no AI)

Turn-based gameplay

Input validation

Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)

Draw detection (when board is full with no winner)

Console display of the game board after every move

How to Compile and Run
To compile the code using g++, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp
./tic_tac_toe
Make sure your compiler supports C++11 or later.

How to Play
The game starts automatically when run.

The board is displayed in the console. It is a 3x3 grid indexed from 0 to 2 for both rows and columns.

Players take turns. Player X always starts first, followed by Player O.

When prompted, enter your move as two integers separated by a space — the row and column where you want to place your mark.

Example: 1 2 means row 1, column 2.

If a player tries to move to an occupied or out-of-bounds space, the move is rejected and the same player is asked to try again.

After each move, the board is updated and displayed.

The game ends when:

One player gets three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

All spaces are filled without a winner (draw).

Game Layout Example

If Player X makes a line across, down, or diagonally, a message like this will display:

Code Overview
Class: TicTacToe
Private Members:
vector<vector<char>> board
Represents the 3×3 game board initialized with spaces ' '.

char currentPlayer
Keeps track of whose turn it is: 'X' or 'O'.

Public Methods:
TicTacToe()
Constructor that initializes the board and sets the starting player to 'X'.

void displayBoard()
Displays the current state of the board in the console.

bool placeMark(int row, int col)
Attempts to place the current player's mark at the given position. Returns false if invalid.

bool checkWin()
Checks if the current player has a winning combination on the board.

void switchPlayer()
Changes the current player from 'X' to 'O' or vice versa.

void playGame()
Main game loop that handles turns, input, win/draw logic, and displays the final result.

main()
Creates a TicTacToe object and starts the game.

Input Notes
Input is taken via std::cin.

Always enter valid integers between 0 and 2 for rows and columns.

Invalid inputs (out of bounds or occupied cells) will prompt the same player to try again.

Customization Ideas
Add a score counter for multiple rounds.

Allow players to enter names.

Add an AI opponent using minimax algorithm.

Make the board size dynamic (e.g., 4x4 or NxN).
